## Installation

I have use ```npm``` as a package manager.
Run the following commands to install the things.

```bash
npm init -y
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer vite
npx tailwindcss init -p
```
Also run to install node_module
```bash
  npm i
```
* I have also install ```vite``` as it reload the site automatically when some changes happen.
* Create an “Input.css” file
Add below text to your HTML and edit it with the below piece of content:
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities; 

* In the tailwind.config.js file, You have to replace “content: []” with “content: [“*”]”.
* Moreover, You have to add “start”: “vite” to your scripts in package.json.
* Finally, you have to run the npm run start command to start a dev server.
